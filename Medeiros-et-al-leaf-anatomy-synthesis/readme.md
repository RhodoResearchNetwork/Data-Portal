Summary
Rationale: Plant resource strategies negotiate a trade-off between fast growth and stress resistance, characterized by specific leaf area (SLA). 
How SLA relates to leaf structure and function, or plant climate associations remains open for debate, and leaf habit and plant architecture may alter the costs versus benefits of individual traits.
Methods: We used Phylogenetic Correspondence analysis and Phylogenetic Least Squares to understand the relationship of anatomy and gas exchange to published data on root, wood, architectural and leaf economics traits, and climate. 
Key results: Leaf anatomy was structured by leaf habit and carbon to nitrogen ratio was a better predictor of gas exchange than SLA. 
We found significant correspondence of leaf anatomy with branch architecture and wood traits, gas exchange corresponded with climate, while leaf economics corresponded with climate, architecture, wood, and root traits. 
Species from the most seasonal climates had the highest trait-climate correspondence, and different aspects of economics and anatomy reflected leaf carbon uptake versus water use. 
Main conclusion: Compared to studies of SLA alone, studies including plant architecture and leaf habit can provide additional insight into how whole-plant economics relates to climate, 
demonstrating the evolutionary and ecological relevance of trait-trait correlations within a genus with high biodiversity.
