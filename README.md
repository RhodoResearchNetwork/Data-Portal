Published and unpublished datasets on Rhododendron

Scope: Any type of non-genetic data on Rhododendron. Genetics data should be submitted to GenBank.

Types of submissions: 1) submit links to Rhododendron data housed in other locations on the internet, or 2) submit datasets to be stored directly in this data portal.

Instructions for submitting links to data housed in other locations:
Please make a new entry with the following information 1) title of the dataset, 2) brief description of the data, and 3) link to the location of the dataset.

Instructions to submit datasets to be stored directly in this data portal:
Data set Formats: Individual files should be less than 1MB, accepted file types include .csv, .txt, .R, .py
If you have other file types or larger files, please contact Juliana Medeiros jmedeiros@holdenfg.org to discuss options for contributing to the data portal.

For each dataset, upload a single file, or create a new folder if there are multiple files for the same submission, using the name of the dataset as the file or folder title. 
Please upload 1) required documentation (described below), 2) data and code files, 3) deviations from the standard data use agreement (example provided below). 

Required documentation:
1) Metadata - All the information someone would need to understand how and why the data were collected.  
Project title:  
Data set creator:  
Contact information:  
Dates of data collection: 
Abstract: 200 to 400 words describing the motivation, design and results of the study 
Methods: Details of experimental design, equipment used, detailed information about data calculations and locations where seeds or samples were obtained (GPS or similar co-ordinates), etc. 
Publications arising from these data:
Table variables: list the column headings, their meanings and units and data coding. 

2) Data tables and/or code files
All raw data and code files used to analyze the data. Do not include derivative data, that is, data calculated from measurements, from model simulations or data analysis. Only RAW data is included. Note that raw data may have been processed from instrument output (i.e. calibrations or data cleaning). Do not include formulas in the data table. Formulas used to calculate data points should be included in the methods section of the metadata and/or in table variables section (see above for description). Do not include copyrighted data of others. 

3) Standard data use agreement 
For items uploaded to this archive, please include any deviations from this standard agreement in your submission.
Permission to use published datasets will be granted free of charge subject to the terms listed in the dataset entry within this repository. Each dataset entry should specify data use agreements using the following terms: 
a) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from the Datasets provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying the Datasets. Any other uses for the Datasets or derived products will require explicit permission from the Dataset Creator. 
b) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of the Datasets. The Data User will not redistribute the original Datasets beyond this collaboration sphere. 
c) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Datasets in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Datasets. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset web location and access date.  
d) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge the Rhododendron Research Network and any institutional support or specific funding awards supporting the data collection referenced in the metadata accompanying the Datasets, in any publications where the Datasets contributed significantly to its content. 
e) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with copies of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or online access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work.  
f) Collaboration. The Datasets have been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creators.
